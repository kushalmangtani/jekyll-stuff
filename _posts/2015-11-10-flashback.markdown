It has been an Year since the last time, I blogged. So, seems like a perfect time to give a quick status on things.

Off-work

This year had some surprises to it. Made some really good friends for life, pet owned a cat and in a relationship :)

Work life
---------

Setted up the building blocks of a Stream-Processing layer for our Big data team (Apache Spark is awesome!), 
Managed an intern team to setup a chatOps app,etc.   

Sum it up
